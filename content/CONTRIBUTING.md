# Contributing
See a typo? Or want to elaborate on a strategy? Or have a better/different strategy? Write it up and submit it as a PR.

You can contribute by:
- Emailing me directly: [toli@tolicodes.com](mailto:toli@tolicodes.com)
- Submitting an [Issue](https://github.com/tolicodes/principles/issues) to this repository: in the form of a question, suggestion, comment, really whatever. It will be public and others can comment on it
- Submitting a [PR](https://github.com/tolicodes/principles/pulls) by forking this repo, and adding/changing whatever you wish.  GitHub has an [article](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) about how to do this. Additionally, there are change/[create](https://github.com/tolicodes/principles/new/master) buttons in the repo which let you do almost any change from the web UI and will guide you through creating a PR. If you have trouble, just email me, and I'll assist (and eventually write up a tutorial)
