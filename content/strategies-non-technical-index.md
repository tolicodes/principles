## Listening to your intuition and quieting your worries

This is a great technique to listen to what your intuition has to say and point you to ideas that excite you and quiet the worries you have about them.

**Nose Is Blocking your Intuition**: The basic idea is that everyone has intuition, it’s just that all the noise in your head is blocking you from hearing it. This is a technique to quiet that noise.

We all have great ideas for what excites us - business ideas, ideas of a relationship with someone, an activity we want to do. But we don’t do them or do them poorly because something is blocking our energy. Some worry or insecurity. This practice allows you to identify what those blocks are, where they are in your body, and lets you unblock their energy.

### The Technique

1. Close your eyes
2. Sit in a quiet space and imagine a connection from your spine into the middle of the earth.
3. Imagine yourself sitting inside your head behind your closed eyes looking out and feel how safe and quiet it is inside your head
4. Notice what worries come in your head and let them pass by, waving hi to them. These worries have been instilled in you by past experiences, other people, our school system, parents. They don’t represent reality. Not right now. So recognize them and let them pass.
5. Let your intuition tell you what you’re most excited about. What comes to mind. It could be a business idea, or the idea of getting into a relationship with someone, or an activity you want to do. Feel that excitement
6. The next step is building energy. An easy way to do it is to open up your palms for a few seconds, stretch them out. And then hold them next to each other, cupping an imaginary ball of energy. Notice how that energy feels. It usually feels like heat or tingling, the little ball getting smaller and larger
7. Remember your Idea from step 5 and feel it again.
8. Notice all the worries and what if’s that come up about the idea. If it’s a business idea those worries could be something like “I can’t raise funding” or “this is too difficult”. If it’s a relationship, “what if she doesn’t like me”.
9. Notice where those worries feel in your body. For example the chest or heart, or stomach
10. Take the ball of energy and push it against that area, letting the worries fade away.
11. Let your enthusiasm and passion fill the space where your worries were.

### Example

1. As I was sitting for the first few steps, I had the regular chatter in my brain. Random thoughts. It felt calmer when I just imagined myself inside my head with the ideas floating outside of me. Sure my brain is having the thoughts but they aren’t part of me. I can just let them pass.
2. My intuition focused on a business idea I had a while back about building a directory of practical techniques and exercises (like this one) that can help you with emotional and spiritual problems.
3. The worries that came in my head were - what if I can’t get anyone to join me in this, what if people won’t use it, what if I give up on the idea like I usually do
4. I felt all these worries in my chest. When I pressed the energy against my chest I felt some of the worries become less loud and I regained excitement for my idea

## Decision Making

We often have worries about which path to take when making an important decision. This technique helps you visualize how you feel making each choice and reveal any alternative, better choices you could take. It helps you finally make that decision and not look back, clearing up your worries about it.

### The Technique

1. Close your eyes
2. Imagine the choices you could take as paths. You’re standing at a crossroads where you see all those possible path.
3. For each decision, imagine yourself walking down that path. How do you feel, does it feel right, who are the people with you on that path. Then go back to the very beginning at the crossroads.
4. When you do your last past go back and see if any new paths opened up. Go down that path and see how it feels.
5. Choose the path that feels the best, where you feel happiest.
6. Cup your hands together and build a ball of energy
7. Send that energy onto the path you’re going to take as light, clearing up any doubt you have about it.

### Example

1. When I closed my eyes the problem that came to mind was going back to work. I’ve been on medical leave for a while for depression. And before leaving I was quite resentful of my boss making me do projects that did not interest me, not giving me the vacation time when I needed it, and not letting me work from where I want to work.
2. The paths in front of me was to tell my job I quit or stick with my current job.
3. When I went down the path of quitting I felt scared and alone. I felt financially insecure. I don’t think I would make good future decisions if I don’t feel financially safe.
4. When I went down the path of staying at my job I also felt bad. I felt the depression returning, having to work on projects that didn’t interest me, experiencing all those problems I had before
5. The third path that opened up was going back to my job but doing a side business on the side about what I’m passionate about. That path still felt scary but less than the other ones. Unlike the other paths, where I was alone, I saw my friends Ray, Alton, and Asya on that path with me.
6. I sent light down the third path and felt more confident about that decision. I started realizing also, that I had this idea that my business has to be about me coding an app. But that idea doesn’t necessarily have to be true. Maybe it’s more about writing than it is coding.
