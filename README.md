# Principles

## TOC
This book/guide is separated into a few sections:

### [Preface](./preface.md)
The preface talks a little bit about why I started this project.

### [How I Got There](./how-i-got-there.md)
This section gives you a look into how I arrived to some of the principles in this book. Well really, just a tiny tiny portion of my much larger story, which I will backfill and front fill as my life moves forward. Sometimes the journey is far more important than the destination!

### [What I Learned About Life (Life Principles)](./life-principles.md)
This section details the principles by which I try to run my life.

### [What I Learned About Tech (Technical Principles)](./technical-principles)
My main craft is programming. Over the years I've developed principles specific to Programming. While the concepts can be applied throughout your life in general, this section contains a lot of technical language (such as PRs, commits, modules).

## Motivation
Initially I wrote this collection of ideas as a preface to [InfraGen's Guide](http://github.com/hoverinc/infragen/guide). However it quickly got much larger than a preface should ever be. I also realized that none of the material there was InfraGen specific, so in the spirit of modularity (one of the [Technical Principles](./technical-principles.md) I practice), I separated it into its own repo which will develop independently from InfraGen.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to describe guiding principles and solutions to common obstacles that I faced in life, and provide stories to show how I got there. My hope is that it will serve as inspiration for others facing similar issues. I hope that they will meditating on the obstacles in their life, and create their own "Principles" and share them with the world.

## Contributing

The [OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md) document is a scratch pad of idea of what I will write about next and how to organize it.
